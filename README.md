 coffeapp
An app I made for class a while back
Hello. This is just an app I programmed in Kotlin for a project. It's nothing special, but hey, I made it, and I'm proud of it. The app opens with three coffee options, and by pressing the one you want, a little prompt pops up that lets you know you've selected an option.
